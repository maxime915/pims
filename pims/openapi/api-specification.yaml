    Cytomine Python Image Managament Server (PIMS) HTTP API. While this API is intended to be internal, a lot of the
    following specification can be ported to the external Cytomine API.

    # Additional API formats
    In addition to OpenAPI types and formats, the following table contains some additional formats used in this
    specification.

    description: |
      Tiles are non-overlaping rectangular regions covering an image at given resolution (a tier in a pyramidal image).

      Tile size is fixed except right-most or bottom-most tiles which might be smaller. It very often depends on
      internal image parameters. Common tile sizes are `256*256` and `512*512`.

      ### Input region
      * Tile index and tier (zoom or level)
      * Tile coordinates and tier (zoom or level)

      ### Target size
      Always defined by underlying image tile size.
  - name: Windows
    description: |
      Windows are rectangular portions extracted from the underlying image content (input region) and optionnaly
      rescaled (target size).

      ### Input region
      * Region (top, left, width, height) and reference tier (zoom or level)
      * Tile index and tier (zoom or level)
      * Tile coordinates and tier (zoom or level)

      ### Target size
      * Length (largest side)
      * Zoom
      * Level
  - name: Thumbnails
    description: |
      Thumbnails are reduced-size versions of the full underlying image content. While resized are general purpose,
      thumbnails are optimized for human visualisation.

      ### Input region
      Always full underlying image.

      ### Target size
      * Length (largest side)
      * Width
      * Height
  - name: Resized

      Resized are reduced-size versions of the full underlying image content. While thumbnails are optimized for
      human visualisation, resized are general purpose.

      ### Input region
      Always full underlying image.

      ### Target size
      * Length (largest side)
      * Width
      * Height
      * Zoom
      * Level
  - name: Annotations
    description: |
      Annotations are geometries that can be reprsented on an image crop in various ways.

      ### Input region
      Always rectangular envelope of all geometries multiplied by an optional context factor.

      ### Target size
      * Length (largest side)
      * Width
      * Height
      * Zoom
      * Level

        **`GET with body` - when a GET with URL encoded query parameters is not possible due to URL size limits, a POST

        The mask is a generated image where geometries are filled by their respective `fill_color`. The background is
        black.

        The input spatial region is given by the rectangular envelope of all geometries multiplied by an optional
        context factor. The target size is given by one of the scaling factors (`size`, `width`, `height`, `zoom` or
        `level`).

        By default, a binary mask with white foreground is returned as the default fill color is white for every
        annotation.

        Annotation `stroke_width` and `stroke_color` are ignored.

        The crop is similar to an image window but where the transparency of the background can be adjusted.

        The input spatial region is given by the rectangular envelope of all geometries multiplied by an optional
        context factor. The target size is given by one of the scaling factors (`size`, `width`, `height`, `zoom` or
        `level`).

        By default, the background transparency is set to 100 which is also known as *alpha mask*. When the
        background transparency is set to 0, foreground and background cannot be distinguished.

        Annotation `fill_color`, `stroke_width` and `stroke_color` are ignored.

        The RFC7232 If-None-Match header field in a request requires the server
        to only operate on the resource if it does not match any of the provided
        entity-tags. If the provided entity-tag is `*`, it is required that the
        resource does not exist at all (see [RFC 7232 Section

        The RFC 7234 Cache-Control header field is providing directives to
        control how proxies and clients are allowed to cache responses results
        for performance. Clients and proxies are free to not support caching of
        results, however if they do, they must obey all directives mentioned in
        [RFC-7234 Section 5.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234) to the
        word.

        In case of caching, the directive provides the scope of the cache
        entry, i.e. only for the original user (private) or shared between all
        users (public), the lifetime of the cache entry in seconds (max-age),
        and the strategy how to handle a stale cache entry (must-revalidate).
        Please note, that the lifetime and validation directives for shared
        caches are different (s-maxage, proxy-revalidate).

        information, to ensure that it delivers the correct cache entry (see
